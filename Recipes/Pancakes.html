    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100g Plain Flour</li>
        <li>2 Large eggs</li>
        <li>300ml milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Caster Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put 100g plain flour, 2 large eggs, 300ml milk, 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil and a pinch of salt into a bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter. This should be similar in consistency to single cream.</li>
        <li>Set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away.</li>
        <li>Set a medium frying pan or crÃªpe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>When hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, using around half a ladleful of batter per pancake. Keep them warm in a low oven as you make the rest.</li>
        <li>Once cold, you can layer the pancakes between baking parchment, then wrap in cling film and freeze for up to two months.</li>
    </ol>
