    <p>This is a traditional vegetable soup that is native to the Akwa-Cross region of Nigeria. It is made with Afang leaves and waterleaf or spinach.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Afang Leaves</li>
        <li>Spinach or Waterleaf</li>
        <li>Palm Oil</li>
        <li>Stock Fish</li>
        <li>Crayfish</li>
        <li>Beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot boil goat meat, add salt, water and seasoning cube. Allow to cook. When it is half way cooked, add pre-boiled Ponmo, washed and deboned smoked fishes, smoked prawns, crayfish, stir and allow to cook some more till it is done and the liquid level is reduced.</li>
        <li>Chop and wash Waterleaf with a scrubbing method (see this video for demonstration), set in a sieve to drain.</li>
        <li>Wash Afang leaves and slice them. Next it would need to be pounded (with crayfish) or an easier method I use is place it in a blender, add some water and blend.</li>
        <li>Add washed Waterleaf to the pot of boiling meats and fishes, add periwinkle, more crayfish and season to taste.</li>
        <li>Cover and allow to cook some more for 5 minutes, you will notice the Waterleaf will release water and if your initial stock was not properly reduced, your soup may end up being too watery.</li>
        <li>Serve with Eba or my favourite, Fufu.</li>
    </ol>
